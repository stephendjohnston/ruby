**Chess Board Cell Colour**
===

_Problem:_
---

Given two cells on the standard chess board, determine whether they have the same color or not. (board is square 8 x 8)

_Examples:_
---

For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "H3", the output should be false.
For cell1 = "A1" and cell2 = "C3", the output should be true.

_Data Structures:_
---

hash
array
integer

_Algorithm:_
---

MENTAL MODEL:
- how to represent the board?
  - array of 2 arrays
    - first array will represent columns a, c, e, g
    - second column will represnt columns b, d, f, h
- find out what colour cell each marker is on, then compare the 2 cells
  -

Algo:
- initialize variable constant BOARD
- initialize variable constant ODD_COLUMNS
- initialize variables to represent the letter and the number of the input cells
- initiale variables to reperesent what colour each cell is
- if ODD_COLUMNS inlcudes the letter of the input cell
  -
