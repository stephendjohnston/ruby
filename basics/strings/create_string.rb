# LS solution

empty_string = String.new

=begin

In Ruby, strings can be created in multiple ways. Empty strings, 
however, can only be created in two ways. In the solution, we use
one of the two ways, which is invoking String's ::new class method.
The second way involves the use of a string literal, like so: see first 
solution above.
